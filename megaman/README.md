## Prerequisites
- In the Menu, ensure the following settings are set:
    - 'Button Config'='Type 1'
    - 'Display Settings'::'Color Space'=Rec.709
    - 'Display Settings'::Filter=On
## Usage
- See Usage in each respective script
- Executable scripts are in this directory
- Scripts with prefix mmbnx will hopefully eventually be compatible with all games, but please see their respective 'Compatibility' sections for current status
- Recommended to use mmbnx-script-launcher.ahk to launch other scripts
## Troubleshooting
- Scripts created with 4k resolution, though theoretically the scripts should be resolution independent
