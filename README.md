# ahk
## Prerequisites
- [Install ahk v1 and v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/howto/Install.htm) (NOTE: v2 is used as much as possible)
- Symlinks must be enabled on your system
    - If symlinks are not working, an alternative is to delete all lib directories other than ahk\lib, then copy ahk\lib to the location of the other lib directories
